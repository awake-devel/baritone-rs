# Porting safety

**Status: proposed on 2026-11-05. Not built yet, apart from the two tools named below.**

How baritone-rs shows that the port behaves like Baritone, and where it knowingly doesn't. The method follows
Horizon's for Minecraft ([parity workflow](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/blob/main/docs/parity-workflow.md),
[port ledger](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/blob/main/docs/port-ledger.md)), scaled down to a small project
on one laptop.

## The rules

1. **Upstream's code is the specification, not our memory of it.** A rule is translated from the pinned commit: same
   order of operations, same constants, same conditions.
2. **Evidence means running the real thing.** A comparison feeds the same inputs to upstream's Java and to our Rust.
   The Java side runs upstream's real classes. It is never a second implementation of the algorithm.
3. **Every difference is written down.** A place where we differ from upstream, on purpose, has a deviation entry. A
   difference with no entry fails the check.
4. **Report the tested scope, never a percentage.** "1,920,000 comparisons match" describes those inputs only. No finite
   set of inputs proves equivalence, so this project never claims "100% parity".
5. **A clean result has to prove it could have failed.** Each comparison comes with injected errors that it must catch.
6. **A test that did not run is not a pass.** Skipped cases are recorded as skipped.

## Levels of evidence

Each level answers a different question. Passing one says nothing about the next.

| Level | Question | How | Needs the game |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0 Rules** | Does each translated function give upstream's answer? | Bit-exact comparison per function, over generated grids | No |
| **L1 Facts** | Does Horizon describe each block as Minecraft does? | Horizon's facts against Java's, for every block state | No |
| **L2 Search** | Does the same world and goal give the same path? | Whole searches compared node by node | No |
| **L3 Scenarios** | Does the player actually get there in Horizon? | Fixed worlds played in the client, with pass criteria | Yes |
| **L4 Servers** | Does it hold on a real server? | Allowed servers only, reported per server | Yes |

- **L0** exists for two functions: [`tools/cost-compare`](../tools/README.md).
- **L1** does not exist. Today's tool gets its facts from Java, so nothing yet shows that Horizon's data gives the same
  answers. This is the largest gap between what has been tested and what will run.
- **L2** needs a node cap in place of upstream's time limits, which would otherwise make runs differ.
- **L3** exists as a first step: [`tools/walk-test`](../tools/README.md) drives a fixed course. A scenario checks arrival,
  time and blocks changed. It does not claim tick-for-tick equality with Java Minecraft, because nothing compares them
  yet.
- **L4** is manual and needs the owner's go-ahead for each server.

Layers we redesign (world access, threads, cache, processes) have no upstream behaviour to match line by line. They get
ordinary tests for the properties that matter, such as "a cancelled search never installs a path", and then L2 and L3
cover them from outside.

## Two upstream branches, one game

Rules come from upstream's `1.21.4` branch, which has the fixes. Horizon is Minecraft 26.3. So a comparison against
`1.21.4` alone tests rules on the wrong game.

Comparisons therefore run against both when a rule depends on game data:

- **`1.21.4` (JDK 21):** the source of the rules.
- **`26.3` (JDK 25, not yet tried):** upstream on the same game as Horizon, and the reference for L1.

Where the two disagree, the disagreement gets a deviation entry that says which one we follow.

## The ledger

`docs/port-ledger.tsv` has one row per upstream method in scope:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `port` | Translated. The Rust function's doc comment opens with the method: `` /// `MovementTraverse.cost`: ... `` |
| `redesign` | Same behaviour on purpose, new structure. Says what replaces it. |
| `drop` | Not needed. Says why. |
| `later` | In scope for a later stage. |
| `missing` | Not decided yet. The default. |

A row also records the upstream commit and a hash of the method's text, and which comparison covers it, if any.

A script checks the ledger against both sides:

- A cited method must exist at the pinned commit.
- A `port` row must have a Rust function citing it.
- A method whose text changed in a newer upstream is listed. That list is the work needed to take a later fix.

This is also how the license's provenance requirement gets met: every file and function says where it came from.

## Deviations

`docs/deviations.md` lists each intentional difference: the upstream behaviour, ours, why, and how the comparison is
told to expect it. An exception must be as narrow as the behaviour. It names the function and the condition, never
"ignore this function".

Candidates from the audit are fixes such as the cache's wrong Y key and the inverted water flow test. Fixes that change
which paths get chosen need the owner's decision. Two examples are making spawner avoidance work, which is dead upstream,
and the Y heuristic, which is kept as is for now.

## Java traps

Each one is a way for a correct-looking translation to give a different answer. The first two have already been seen in
this project.

| Trap | Rule |
|---|---|
| `1 - float` stays a float in Java, then widens | Keep the exact width of each step. Found by injected error. |
| `Math.pow` and friends round differently per library | One small module holds these calls. See below. |
| `int` overflow wraps in Java, panics or wraps in Rust by build | Use explicit `wrapping_*` wherever Java could overflow. |
| `>>`, `/`, `%`, and casts on negative numbers | Translate each case. Never assume. |
| `HashMap` iteration order, tie-breaks in the open set | Reproduce order wherever it can change a result. L2 catches the rest. |
| Null as a meaningful value | Use `Option`. Note each place where this removes an upstream bug. |
| Unsynchronized data shared between threads | Never translate it. The design replaces it. |

### Floating point

Horizon's `jmath` module exists because Rust's float functions don't always round like HotSpot's. A mod's own crate
can't depend on `horizon-core`, so we can't use it from there.

The exposure is small in the pathing, behavior and pathing API code: `Math.pow` is called twice, and the rest are `abs`,
`min`, `max`, `sqrt`, `ceil`, `round` and `toRadians`. So:

- All such calls go through one module.
- The fall-cost table is compared in full, all 4,097 entries, against Java.
- The `pow` result has only been checked on x86-64 Linux. Other platforms stay unverified until they are compared.

## The gate

`tools/gate.py` is what a change must pass before it is committed. It stops at the first failure:

1. Public-tree check: no game files, generated data or private details in the repository.
2. `cargo fmt --check`, then `cargo clippy -D warnings`.
3. Unit tests. These include small hand-written fixtures with no Minecraft data, so they can run anywhere.
4. Ledger check.
5. The comparisons whose inputs changed, at low priority if another build or game is running.
6. For a new or changed comparison: three identical runs, and the injected errors.

Injected errors that go uncaught must each be classified, as either a real hole in the test or an error with no possible
effect. A hole stays listed until it is closed.

Known holes today:

- Tool choice, because a bare `Bootstrap` has no block tags, so a pickaxe and an empty hand give the same break speed.
- An open top trapdoor, which the block list lacks.

## Reports

A comparison writes a small JSON report: the upstream commit, the game version, the Java and Rust versions, hashes of the
sources it ran, and its counts. A previous success report is deleted before a new run starts, so that a failed run can't
leave an old pass behind.

Reports hold metadata only and may be committed. Generated data stays local.

## What must never enter the repository

- Minecraft code, data or generated golden files.
- Anything from Sunset, closed clients or Eris.
- The elytra pathfinder's terrain generator files, which upstream describes as coming from Minecraft.
- Tokens, account names, private hostnames or home paths.

### Keeping Horizon clean

Horizon's contribution rules put LGPL code off limits, even to read. So this project's code must never be offered to
Horizon. When we need a hook there, we ask for it by describing the need, and we don't send code from here. Horizon's own
code is MIT, so copying from it is allowed, with its notice kept.

## Stages

Each stage ends with a report to the owner, who decides whether to continue.

| Stage | Work | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **S0** | Ledger, deviations, gate and reports. Close the tool and trapdoor holes. Try the `26.3` comparison. | The gate runs on today's two functions |
| **S1** | The other five movement costs, predicates and goals | L0 on all of them, on all block states of the corpus |
| **S2** | Horizon's facts against Java's | L1 on all block states, with each difference explained |
| **S3** | A*, partial paths and segments | L2 on a corpus of generated worlds |
| **S4** | World access, threads, executor and glue | Property tests, then L3 scenarios |
| **S5** | Servers, if the owner wants it | L4 reports, per server |

S2 comes before S3 on purpose. If Horizon's facts can't support the rules, that needs to be known before building more on
top of them.

## Testing rules in the game

- Use a separate instance and world, never one with other mods or the owner's own worlds.
- Run one full client build at a time, and check that no game or build is already running.
- Use a normal window on the desktop. Never nest a compositor or add outputs.
- Close the game when done.

## Open questions

- Whether upstream's `26.3` branch runs in the comparison, and whether vanilla tags can be loaded without a running game.
- Where `isPathfindable` comes from in Horizon. A trait declaration was found, not its implementation.
- Whether the checks in `tools/gate.py` should later also run on public CI. Without Minecraft there, CI could only run
  steps 1 to 4.
- Whether Horizon's pinned revision stays at `4aa6854`, or moves to one with `native_movement_input`.
